    <h3>Register of Oldham Hulme Grammar School for Boys</h3>

<p>Transcript of the school register for the period May 1895 to July 1928 - Alphabetical Listing.</p>
<p>To comply with Data Protection Regulations, the name of any pupil born after October 1915 is excluded from this published register. Queries concerning pupils who may appear in later registers should be sent to archive@ohgs.co.uk. Whilst every effort has been made to transcribe the registers accurately, some pages are in poor condition and many are difficult to read.</p>
<p>Further information including scholarship awards is shown for some of these pupils but is not available for all year groups. Additional information may also be available in the WW1 section of our website.</p>
<p>Please use your browser's search facility to find a particular name in the list.</p>
